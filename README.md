This project focuses on the prediction of the rating of a review from the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) by processing its textual context. To achieve this objective two distinct methodologies were employed.
The main method is to train a multi layer perceptron to predict the ratings. The second
method uses Logistic Regression, a statistical model, to predict the reviewâ€™s rating by
classifying the reviews into five classes.
By employing these two methodologies, this project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness
of deep learning-based approaches and traditional statistical modeling techniques
in review rating prediction on the Yelp Reviews data set.
